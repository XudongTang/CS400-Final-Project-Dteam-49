### What is this?
- This is the final team project of Comp Sci 400 for Fall 2018 UW-Madison. 
- The project is called Food Query, it contains four classes: FoodItem, FoodData, BPtree and Main (The function of each class will be described below).
- This project contains 2 .css files and 2 .jpg files for styling. You also need a .csv file for input.
- The project is done by a team of 5 members: Yixian Gan, Xudong Tang, Yiye Dang, Daoxing Zhang and Qiuhong Li.
- The team takes credit for implementing all the classes and designing the GUI.
- The team takes no credit for setting up the project. Remember, this is just a school project so all credits for the idea of this project go to Prof. Deppler of UW-Madison.
### How does this work?
- This project analyze the nutrient information of the selected food.
- Users need to upload a .csv file containing food information which includes ID, name and the value of each nutrient.
- Users then could select the food from the .csv file and add to the meal list for analyzing.
- User could add food by fill in all the info that is required
- User could select food by filtering with name or the value of nutrients.
### What does each class do?
- FoodItem: Each food and its info is stored in a FoodItem object.
- FoodData: This class enables changes of food items that has been uploaded.
- BPTree: This class saves the value of each nutrient for all the food. Special credit for Yixian Gan to implement the whole Class since this is pretty hard.
- Main: This is where the GUI sets up and enables the functionality.
### Notice
- This project has no known bug currently, but there might be bugs that hasn't been discovered.
- please put the "help.jpg" in the source directory instead of the application package directory. 
- all the other files should go to the application package directly
### Special Credit
Great thanks to YiFeng Yu from China Academy of Art for not making the GUI's css style looks absolutely horrible.
